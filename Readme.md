## Overview

This repository contains JSON files generated automatically from JSDoc comments in the [codebase](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/sdkjs). These files can be used to generate documentation, power developer tools, or integrate with other systems that require structured data about the code. To build JSON files use a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/office-js-api-declarations/actions/workflows/build.yml) that run [python scripts](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/build_tools/tree/release/v8.2.0/scripts/sdkjs_common/jsdoc).
